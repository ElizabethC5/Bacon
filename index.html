            <span class="text3"><strong>Bacon Lettuce Tomato (BLT) Appetizer Bites</strong></span><br />
            Toast bread, apply butter to bread (may cut off crust), cut bread into 4 or more pieces that are bite sized. Fry thick bacon, cut into bite-size pieces, tear Romaine lettuce into bite-size pieces, spear cherry tomato on toothpick with
            lettuce, bacon and bread. Yummy! (Healthy tip: use olive oil instead of butter, use turkey bacon, use whole-wheat bread.)
          </p>
          <p class="text2">
            <span class="text3"><strong>Brussel Sprouts with Bacon</strong></span><br />
            After cleaning, cut fresh brussel sprouts in half if small or in 3 pieces. Chop bacon before frying, fry bacon with a small amount of olive oil until crisp. Add brussel sprouts to pan on medium heat, stir, cover for 3-5min, season with
            salt and pepper, simmer on low for 5-10 minutes, stir every so often. This is good as a side dish.

          <p class="text2">
            <span class="text3"><strong>Corn Salad with Pancetta</strong></span><br />
            Clean corn salad (also called Rapunzel salad or in German "Feldsalat"). Chop walnuts or pecans. Chop and fry red onion. Fry pancetta until beginning to brown, add chopped red onion. Drain and reserve the fat. Mix corn salad with onion,
            pancetta and nuts, May add cranberries or blood orange pieces. Mix balsamic vinegar with the pancetta fat with the proportion of 1/3 vinegar to 2/3 fat. Drizzle over salad and mix. Heavenly! Serve with Riesling white wine. (Even
            healthier
            tip, substitute extra virgin olive oil for the pancetta fat.)
