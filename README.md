# Bacon
web development assignment based on bacon, freedom of format and content, a few good bacon recipes

The I love bacon page was a result of an assignment for web development. The instructor provided the I love bacon title, the word "bacon" as a repeat and a picture of bacon. 

I had the word bacon in the title rotate with other words, changed the picture and added a transparent type background and a column with bacon recipes. The rotating cycle of text in the title is mostly not my own invention, I do get what the code is doing, though and was able to tweak it for my needs. I still could not reproduce that out of my head though. 

I tried so many different types of columns being a beginner of sorts The transparent type background seemed to throw everything off, I could not get anything centered properly and know that using padding for width is not optimal. I decided on flexbox for the structure. It was the only type of structure that I tried that worked with the background. I have yet to try to use a grid structure. 

When a smaller screen is used to view the webpage or the screen width shrinks the righthand column will fall below the left. I also set the page so that the size of the text is retained for better reading on a small screen.

I plan to make all further sites in a flexible way so that they can be viewed on cell phones and tablets as well as computers. I also want to make at least some that are more handicapped friendly such as for the blind and colorblind. I still have to look up how to do that.

Thank you for stopping by!
